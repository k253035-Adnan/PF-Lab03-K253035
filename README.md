My name is **Adnan Khan**\
I have done my Intermediate in ***PRE ENGINEERING*** in Karachi Board\
I have interest in programming because I want to develop a Software unlike normal social media apps, I want to create something different like a ***Learning and Development Tool or a Project Database Organizing Tool***\
I want to learn and nourish my skills as much as possible in my College Years because after graduating I do not want to do a corporate Job but rather design and develop softwares and sell them to companies who need my softwares and my services.
